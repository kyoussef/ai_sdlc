# Code Review Request

Please perform a comprehensive code review by comparing the git differences between two branches and provide detailed analysis.

## Task
1. **Fetch git diff** between the specified branches
2. **Analyze all changes** in the context of the codebase
3. **Provide structured feedback** on code quality and potential issues

## Review Areas
Evaluate the changes against these criteria:

### Code Quality & Standards

For every bulk of change in a file, analyze and provide your feedback, positive and negative and why in both cases. 
- **Coding practices**: Following established patterns and conventions
- **Code style**: Consistency with project style guidelines
- **Design patterns**: Proper implementation of architectural patterns
- **SOLID principles**: Adherence to software design principles
- **UI and UX**: Adherence to the general UI/UX principles adopted by the project, and UI mockups, and common sense of laying out components and controls. 
- **Performance Considerations**: If the adopted method is the best method in terms of performance, would there be edge cases that might break it or cause performance issues. 

### Functional Analysis
- **Business logic**: Alignment with requirements and business rules
- **Error handling**: Proper exception management and validation
- **Data flow**: Correct handling of data transformations and persistence

### Non-Functional Concerns
- **Security**: Potential vulnerabilities or security risks
- **Performance**: Impact on application performance and scalability
- **Maintainability**: Code readability and future maintenance considerations
- **Testing**: Test coverage and testability of changes

Please be thorough in your explanation, focusing on actionable feedback that improves code quality.
