# Evaluation Results

| Category | Score | Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docs & Prompts | 6/10 | Requirements, plan, and design are detailed with user stories and diagrams (`docs/plan.md`, `docs/tech_design_res.md`), but pervasive encoding artifacts (for example `docs/initial_requirements.md`) and drift around due-date optionality reduce clarity. |
| Code Prompts | 6/10 | Prompts articulate clean-architecture expectations (`prompts/document_prompt.md`), yet some mandates (e.g., OpenAPI 3.1 in `prompts/tech_design_prompt.md`) are not reflected in the implementation, revealing limited practical guidance. |
| Requirement Coverage | 4/10 | Implementation forces due dates and misses tag normalization/length checks, conflicting with `docs/final_requirements.md`; ProblemDetails responses omit the required `errors` map and CSV import returns ad-hoc JSON (`src/TodoApp.Api/Middleware/ProblemDetailsMiddleware.cs`, `src/TodoApp.Api/Controllers/TasksController.cs`). |
| Creativity | 7/10 | CSV import, correlation-ID middleware, and deterministic seeding (`src/TodoApp.Application/Tasks/TaskService.cs`, `src/TodoApp.Api/Middleware/CorrelationIdMiddleware.cs`, `src/TodoApp.Infrastructure/Data/DbSeeder.cs`) go beyond baseline MVP requirements. |
| Architecture | 6/10 | Layering is respected with thin controllers and repository abstractions (`src/TodoApp.Api/Program.cs`, `src/TodoApp.Infrastructure/Startup/InfrastructureServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`), but CSV parsing in the service layer and in-memory tag filtering (`src/TodoApp.Application/Tasks/TaskService.cs`, `src/TodoApp.Infrastructure/Data/Repositories/TaskRepository.cs`) hurt scalability. |
| Security & Compliance | 4/10 | Security headers lack the required CSP and request-size limits (`docs/final_requirements.md`, `src/TodoApp.Api/Middleware/SecurityHeadersMiddleware.cs`), while validation relies on generic `ArgumentException` messages without per-field feedback. |
| Testing | 6/10 | Unit and integration tests cover core flows and validation (`tests/TodoApp.Tests/Application/TaskServiceTests.cs`, `tests/TodoApp.Tests/Infrastructure/TaskRepositoryTests.cs`), yet concurrency, ProblemDetails payloads, and broader UI scenarios remain untested. |
| Traceability | 4/10 | Architectural docs align with the code, but both diverge from agreed requirements (due-date optionality, OpenAPI 3.1), and planned UX items like URL state persistence (`docs/plan.md`) are absent. |
| Maintainability | 6/10 | Comprehensive XML comments and READMEs (`src/TodoApp.Api/Controllers/TasksController.cs`, `src/README.md`) aid onboarding, but the monolithic `todo.js` and inconsistent defaults (page size, URL sync) undermine long-term upkeep. |
| Professionalism | 6/10 | Rich artifact set suggests disciplined process, yet encoding corruption (`README.md`, `docs/initial_requirements.md`), requirement misalignment, and incomplete security work prevent a production-ready impression. |

**Overall Score:** 5.5/10

## Top Strengths
- Clean layering with clear API, application, and infrastructure separation (`src/TodoApp.Api/Program.cs`).
- Extensive documentation footprint (requirements, plan, design, openapi, readmes).
- Additional middleware/seeding and progressive enhancements that improve diagnostics and demo value.
- Solid service and repository test coverage across validation and query permutations.

## Improvement Opportunities
- Fix encoding corruption in documentation/prompts to restore clarity.
- Align due-date handling, tag rules, and ProblemDetails payloads with the signed requirements.
- Implement promised UX features (URL state persistence) and update OpenAPI to 3.1 as designed.
- Harden security with CSP, request-size/media-type enforcement on imports, and structured validation errors.

## Recommendation
Needs targeted rework before production readiness; prioritize requirement alignment, validation consistency, and security hardening.
